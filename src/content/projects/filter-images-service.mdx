### A small python service for my *SharedAlbum* app I built using fastAPI.

The main fueature of **SharedAlbum** app is image filters. When users creates an event in the app, they can choose a filter that will be applied on the pictures participants take.

I achieved this by using LUT files for filters and run them through `ffmpeg` in a background process.

Check out this [github repo](https://github.com/duniandewon/filter-processor) to see the complete code.
