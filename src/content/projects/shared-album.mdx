### A web app for participants of an event to share their pictures with one another in real-time.

So when we are in an event, we have to ask for others to share the pictures, or we need to announce to download the pictures from google drive.

With this app the host can ask others to join the event and start taking pictures. The pictures will not only be uploaded automatically, but also a filter of the host's choosing will be applied.
Participants can view and download the images while the event is on going.

Check out this [github repo](https://github.com/duniandewon/filter-processor) to see the complete code or visit the [live demo](https://sharedalbum.netlify.app/signin).
